  <description>As you watch the approaching darkness you know death has come to Rimworld.. 
You turn to yell for the others.. "RUN!" but the Darkness is already upon you. 
Only blackness and your own screams remain...you cannot escape this fate.
The last thing you feel, before you fall into the Abyss, is your flesh being torn from your bones.
The Darkest Night has arrived.

Darkest Night is an event mod for Rimworld, that will make your heart pounding much faster! A lot of impressions by SK Team, Guaranteed. 
In this event darkness has come to Rimworld and with it, death.
Your colony must survive a darkness, so black, nothing can be seen. It is also inhabited by flesh craving creatures. No defenses can save your people. Only the light can keep them at bay.
Once the Darkest Night starts, you will be given a small window to prepare. How you prepare is up to you.
Will you huddle around a campfire or the kitchen lights while your battieries run dry? 
Choose carefully. 
Only two outcomes are certain: Live and see the light again, or die by the claws and teeth of that, which you cannot see, nor fight..</description>
