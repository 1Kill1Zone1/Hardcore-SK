v0.1.1
- Job description column (Jobs view) and colonist name column (all views) now truncate the text instead of awkwardly wrapping it and messing up alignment. Added tooltips to these fields to show the full value.
- Rows and columns that are not in the visible scroll area are no longer rendered.

v0.1.0
- Initial Release
