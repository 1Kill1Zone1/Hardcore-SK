	<description>This mod completely revamps the backstories and traits system in Rimworld. Pawns are now no longer incapable of performing jobs. However, based on their personal traits and backstories, they may not like the jobs assigned to them. Not only will they be unhappy if you assign them a job they don't want to do, they will be slower at doing it, and more likely to do a bad job or even fail at it. And, yes, there is a Useless trait. * Special thanks to Fluffy for helping with the C# code.</description>
