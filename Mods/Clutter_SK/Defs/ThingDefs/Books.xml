	<li>It was the third day of a long and painful siege,</li>
	<li>James and Rookie were dead and buried, and I had my right ear blown off.</li>
	<li>David, our sniper, decided to take it upon himself to free us from this nightmare.</li>
	<li>As he stealthly sneaked about the grass, looking for the raiders' base,</li>
	<li>He suddenly whispered urgently at the comms.</li>
	<li>With my one ear I could make out that one distress signal we never wanted to hear;</li>
	<li>"MAD BOOMRAT!"</li>
	<li>A loud bang sounded far off.</li>
	<li>With my pistol in hand and the comms eerily silent, I opened the colony door.</li>
	<li>The entire field was on fire.</li>
	<li>Looking far away, I saw the fire slowly crawling towards the raiders' base.</li>
	<li>As the fires reached their cannons, two horrible explosions burned at my eyes.</li>
	<li>I was never as happy to feel the rain pour, as it did that night.</li>
	<li>I never did find David's body,</li>
	<li>But as soon as I could, I built a statue in his honor.</li>
