This mod changes the game start. It adds a new event that drops a different spaceship parts on the landing site from the sky. Pods with colonists, containers with resources, engines with flammable fuel, and other useful and dangerous things. This event triggers at the start of the game, so your arrival will be much more similar to the movie crash landing. With the fire, explosions, dead and wounded people. Smaller random crash events can occur later on in the game as well.

You will need to organize the rescue of wounded colonists and supplies. The fire will be your main enemy. It will start as small fires on the impacted tiles, but can quickly grow into major fires if left unchecked. Choose to beat out the small fires or evacuate supplies. Watch out for other dangers. There will be 5 to 10 random crashing pods during this initial event.

There are two modes: Easy and Hard
    Easy mode means that you start with 3 healthy colonists and standard equipment. Random colonist pods will be crash landing hard with little chance of surviving the impact. This is the default setting.
    Hard mode means that your starting colonists and equipment will crash land and take severe damage. More random colonists will be crash landing hard with little chance of surviving the impact.
