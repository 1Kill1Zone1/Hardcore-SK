	<description>This mod expands the social and mood system by adding new traits, interactions, and thoughts. The stories that emerge from your pawns' quirks are the most fun part of RimWorld, and this mod aims to expand on that emergent storytelling by increasing variety.
	
Psychology does not require a new save game.

&lt;b&gt;New Traits&lt;/b&gt;  
- Prude: This old-fashioned pawn hates the sight of nudity, and is mortified by the thought that others might be able to see their private areas. They are eternally disapproving of nudists and bothered by wearing ratty clothing.
- Insomniac: This pawn has a sleeping disorder. They will rarely attempt to sleep, and will never be fully satisfied by doing so. They spend most of their time awake, and thus, productive; but almost always tired.
- Bleeding Heart: This pawn is a big old softie. They will be pleased by doing things that help others, and more traumatized by brutal or senseless acts like mistreatment of prisoners or killing. They also will not get along with psychopaths.
- Gourmet: This demanding pawn expects to eat well every day. They'll be more satisfied by doing so, but more annoyed by having to eat things other than what they want.
- Unstable: This fluctuating pawn experiences random mood swings multiple times a day, and to a greater degree than other pawns, with manic and depressive episodes.
- Lecher: This unabashedly sexual pawn only cares about their own desires. They'll hit on anyone they find attractive, regardless of how they personally feel about them or if they are likely to be reciprocated. Anyone who accepts the advances of this pawn is likely to have their heart broken.
- Codependent: This pawn needs the comfort of intimacy. They will be unhappy when alone, and devastated by breakups and affairs. On the plus side, they are loyal and happy when they have someone to latch on to.
- Outdoorsy: This pawn enjoys spending time in the open. They get a mood boost when there's no roof above their head.
- Pluviophile: This pawn simply likes the sound and feel of rain, and will receive a mood bonus from it.
- Photosensitive: This pawn, either through gene modding or random mutation, has eyes that are extremely sensitive to the light. They will be very unhappy at being exposed to it, but find darkness comforting.
- Socialite: This fun-loving pawn is great at parties, and so your colony will hold them more often as long as they're around.
- Desensitized: This numbed pawn no longer gets mood penalties for witnessing death or observing corpses. They will still be upset by colonists' deaths in general, and by other moral outrages. This trait can potentially be gained during play whenever a pawn sees someone die or looks at a body.
- Heavy Sleeper: This comatose pawn cannot receive mood penalties for disturbed sleep, but is also dificult to wake up.
- Polygamous: This pawn has too much love to share with just one person. They will be unhappy in relationships with non-polygamous pawns, and can romance multiple people.
- Open-Minded: This pawn doesn't suffer negative opinion penalties for people's appearances, and won't take appearance into account in romance.

&lt;b&gt;New Thoughts&lt;/b&gt;  
- Adrenaline Rush: Pawns get a short mood boost when killing a hostile from an enemy faction. This gives them some relief at having defended their home.
- Dreams: Pawns may have dreams while sleeping which can affect their mood.
- Passionate Work: Pawns will be a little happier while doing something they have a burning passion for. (idea credit ({x}) Disarray)
- Imprisonment: They may be willing to join your colony, but pawns you've captured and recruited will be resentful and awkward with the people that imprisoned them, until they get used to their new life.

&lt;b&gt;New Events&lt;/b&gt;  
- Quarrel: Two pawns friendly towards each other have their relationship damaged by an argument until they make up.
- Homesick: One of your pawns is feeling homesick. They may spread it to other pawns through conversation.
- Cliques: Two pawns who dislike each other separate the colony into cliques of their friends. Members of each clique may come to blows.

&lt;b&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/b&gt; 
- Kinsey scale: Instead of using up trait slots for sexualities, pawns are assigned a rating on the Kinsey scale which governs their romantic interactions. They'll also remember the sexualities of people they've attempted to romance, and avoid it in the future if they are incompatible.
- Anxiety: Pawns may start with this health problem, or acquire it during play.
- Empathy: Non-Bleeding Heart pawns do incur slightly smaller mood penalties for thoughts that Bleeding Heart pawns get more upset about.
- Romance: Non-Lecher pawns will not attempt to romance pawns who are in a good relationship, and the likelihood of non-Lecher pawns in a relationship to attempt to romance other pawns is influenced by the strength of their relationship.

&lt;b&gt;COMPATIBILITY&lt;/b&gt;
- Place Psychology as low in your load order as possible, and it will disable its features for compatibility with other mods.
- Always load mods which implement new sexualities BEFORE Psychology. The Kinsey scale will be automatically deactivated if it detects Bisexual or Asexual traits added to the game.
- Psychology adds new properties to pawns. Colonies with Psychology enabled on them may break if the mod is disabled. Colonies without Psychology enabled on them will only receive new functionality on new pawns. Disabling the Kinsey scale for old saves is recommended.
- Psychology detours some of the game's functionality, so other mods which alter the game's code may not work properly if loaded after Psychology. Mods which only modify Defs are 100% compatible with Psychology, as Psychology does not override any core Defs. If two mods are incompatible, ask the author of the OTHER mod to implement a compatibility patch, so you can enjoy the functionality of both. 


MOD AUTHORS: You can use the source code provided with the mod to build compatibility into your mod. Use reflection to access Psychology's traits and thoughts and check if the mod is loaded, then include the mod's functionality in any classes you detour. Then tell your users to load your mod after Psychology, so that it can perform both mods' work (or only yours, if they are not using Psychology). Example:

ThoughtDef kp = DefDatabase&lt;ThoughtDef&gt;.GetNamedSilentFail("KilledPatientBleedingHeart");
if(kp != null)
    surgeon.needs.mood.thoughts.memories.TryGainMemoryThought(kp, patient);
	
This will try to give the pawn Psychology's Bleeding Heart thought, but ONLY if it detects that that thought actually exists (which means Psychology is loaded). Otherwise, it does nothing, because the user isn't using Psychology.
