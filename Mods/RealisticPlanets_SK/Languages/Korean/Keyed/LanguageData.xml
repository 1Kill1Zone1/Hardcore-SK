  <Planets.WorldPresetsTip>The preset options in this list will let you quickly adjust the sliders below to generate specific types of planets. The presets aren't perfect, of course, and in any event, few planets are covered entirely by but a single biome, but using them, you should get planets predominantly characterized by the sort of environment you'd expect from the name.</Planets.WorldPresetsTip>

  <Planets.OceanTypeTip>This setting determines how extensive ocean coverage will be on the world you generate. Watery worlds are mostly covered in water, with only a few small land masses. Arid planets, at the other extreme, have little or no surface water.</Planets.OceanTypeTip>

  <Planets.RainfallTip>This slider influences the planet's overall rainfall. Keep in mind that this is a relative, rather than absolute, setting. An arid planet with "high" rainfall will still be much drier than a watery world with "low" rainfall.</Planets.RainfallTip>
