<RedistHeat_Basics.label>Building duct networks</RedistHeat_Basics.label>
<RedistHeat_Basics.description>A duct network needs three parts: Intakes, pipes, and outlets. Air from intakes will change the network's temperature, while outlets will use it to change its room temperature.</RedistHeat_Basics.description>

<RedistHeat_SmartDucts.label>Using smart duct outlets</RedistHeat_SmartDucts.label>
<RedistHeat_SmartDucts.description>Smart duct outlets are able to close themselves without player interactions. This depends on the room's and the network's temperature that it is connected to.\n\nUsage: Cool a hospital room by using a freezer's cold air without the risk of freezing patients.</RedistHeat_SmartDucts.description>
